# Plaintext Images

Replaces images used to animate/style text with CSS animations, rendering them available to search or copy/paste. Most notable in Trickster Mode, though other examples exist. Text in Flashes and panels is not affected.

It is advised that this mod be placed high in the list, as it will overwrite any modifications previously made to affected pages.
