This task is out of your hands.</span><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">The needles must be acquired from the denizen of the Witch of Space.</span><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">Her quills are very large and potent.

The plans you were making were based on assumptions and fabrications of your imagination. You were writing more stories, much like those about your false magical men.</span><br /><span style=\"color: #b536da\">TT: I wish what I'd written in my private journals could be confined to your dark spots.</span><br /><span style=\"color: #ffffff\">I don't.

She listened to every vision he retold, every lesson he preached, and faithfully recorded his scripture. Her ear was open to him always, and in time, his heart opened to her. To spread his message throughout the world they took to the seas in the vessel of legend known as the First Ship.

	"008316":"Wow!!!!!<br /><br />Wow indeed. <br /><br />Here you go. Aranea's exposition on leprechaun romance, in its entirety, unedited and uncensored, as promised.<br /><br /><span class=\"text_image\" style=\"background-image:url(assets://storyfiles/hs2/scraps/glitchtext4.gif); width:528px; height:1450px;\">The pro8lem is that when the su8ject of leprechaun romance is 8roached, our overly o8essive troll intellects instantly assume the most ingrati8ting posture of admir8tion imagina8le.<br /><br />Which makes it hard! Hard to give it proper academic focus I mean, 8ecause of how gr8 it is.<br /><br />8ut we will do our 8est to understand regardless.<br /><br />Trolls have only four forms of romance. And though we consider it a complic8ted su8ject, spanning a wide range of emotions, social conventions, and implic8tions for reproduction, it is ultim8tely a superficial slice of what leprechauns consider the full 8ody of romantic experience. Our concept of romance, in spite of its capacity to fill our art and literature and to rule our individual destinies like little else, is still just that. A single, quaternary concept. A concept usually denoted 8y four sym8ols.<br /><br />&lt;3 &lt;3&lt; &lt;&gt; o8&lt;<br /><br />Leprechaun romance is more complic8ted than that. Leprechaun romance needs nine sym8ols.<br /><br />The nine quadrants of leprechaun romance are considera8ly more nuanced than our quaint notions of romance, and certainly more alien.<br /><br />In fact, so conditioned is my own understanding of romance that I can't help 8ut refer to them as quadrants, when in fact they are not quadrants at all! They are referred to as charms.<br /><br />One of the charms is characterized 8y romantic love, as understood 8y 8oth trolls and humans. 8ut after that, all 8ets are off. There is no division 8etween 8lack or red, concupiscent or conciliatory. Instead their charms comprise a spectral continuum of more su8tly varying types of relationships, most of which are esta8lished in mutual chicanery, such as the exchange of pranks, coy riddles, slapstick shenanigans, and games of chance. Furthermore, a pair of leprechauns is not limited to a single charm. A relationship may 8e defined 8y multiple charms at once! In fact, some of the most interesting relationships arise from exotic charm com8in8tions. A sta8le relationship consisting of three or more charms is called a trove. These advanced relationships are often viewed as the ideal end result for a romance, much the way certain pairing rituals are for humans.<br /><br />No charm is specifically tied to procre8tion, though any type of relationship could 8egin waxing concupiscent if lady luck should so decide. Certain charm com8in8tions are known to 8e more conducive to fertility than others. If the leprechaun pair has 8een so 8lessed, they will 8egin an ela8orate coupling procedure culmin8ting in a lively m8ting jig. The jigs are specific to the charms of course, similar to how different kinds of music lend themselves to various styles of dance.<br /><br />While their romance is endlessly captiv8ting, leprechaun reproduction may 8e the most interesting su8ject of all. Particularly from a perspective of detailed anatomical study, which I will get to shortly. 8ut first it 8ears pointing out that while for humans reproductive relationships are exclusively heterosexual, and for trolls they are 8isexual, for leprechauns they are exclusively homosexual. Yes, you heard right. That means the Felt are &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; super gay. A graphic description of the reproductive process is &#9617;&#9617; follows&#9617;<br /><br />&#9617;&#9617;&#9617; frog penis &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; muppet buttock &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; chafing &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; wriggling &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; puppet pelvis &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; magic gnome phallus &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; elf eggs &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; burrowed fuck deep &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; perky proboscis &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; coarse kermit cock &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; wrist deep in puppet ass &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; pro8oscalypse &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; soft 8ul8ous 8ottom &#9617;&#9617;&#9617; kind of jutting out and impudent &#9617;&#9617;&#9617;</span>",
